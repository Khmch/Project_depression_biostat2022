country,"The name of the country to which the row relates. It can be:

1) Countries, whose names have been standardized to a common set of country names used across Our World in Data 
2) Regional aggregates provided as standard within the PIP data according to World Bank region definitions."
year,"The following description is adapted from PIP Methodology Handbook: 

Within the PIP data, observations are alocated two different year variables: Year and Survey Year. 

If all fieldwork for a survey took place during one calendar year, and relate to the consumption or income of that year, Year and Survey year are both equal to this calendar year.

When household surveys span two calendar years, the Survey year noted in the PIP data is not an integer. The Gambia, for example, has a Survey year of 2015.31. This means that 69% of the fieldwork for this particular survey took place in 2015 while 31% of the fieldwork months took place in 2016. In these cases, Year is the floor of Survey year (i.e. Survey year always rounded down)."
reporting_level,"The reporting level of the survey. It can be national, urban or rural."
welfare_type,Indicates whether the survey data relates to household income or consumption expenditure.
ppp_version,"The version of the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), which are conversions into international-$ to adjust for inflation and for differences in the
cost of living between countries. It can be 2011 or 2017."

This Survey year variable is used by the World Bank for the purposes of 'linining up' the different country-level estimates in order to calculate regional aggregates."
survey_comparability,"A variable produced by the World Bank that codes more comparable spells of survey data over time within individual countries. A change in the spell group number indicates a break in survey comparability.

The following description is adapted from PIP Methodology Handbook:

As countries frequently improve the questionnaire design of household surveys and the methodology for the construction of welfare aggregates, poverty estimates over time for a country are not always comparable to each other.

In order to guide users about when poverty can be compared over time within a country, [the PIP database includes a 'Comparability over time' variable]. Within a country, comparability of poverty estimates over time is assumed unless there is a known change to the survey instrument, survey methodology, measurement, or data structure. The assessment of comparability is country-dependent and relies on the accumulation of knowledge from past and current World Bank staff, as well as close dialogue with national data producers with knowledge of survey design and methodology. The complete documentation of this dataset is available in Atamanov et al. (2019).

The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. 

It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

gini,"The Gini coefficient measures inequality on a scale between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate greater inequality."
mld,"The mean log deviation (MLD) is a measure of inequality. An MLD of zero indicates perfect inequality and it takes on larger positive values as incomes become more unequal. The measure is also referred to as 'Theil L' or 'GE(0)', in reference to the wider families of inequality measures to which the MLD belongs."
polarization,"The polarization index, also known as the Wolfson polarization index, measures the extent to which the distribution of income or expenditure is “spread out” and bi-modal. Like the Gini coefficient, the polarization index ranges from 0 (no polarization) to 1 (complete polarization). The polarization index is based on Wolfson (1994) and Ravallion and Chen (1997).

It tells you how many times richer someone just in the the poorest tenth would need to be in order to be counted in the richest tenth.
p90_p50_ratio,P90 is the the level of income or expenditure above which 10% of the population lives. P50 is the median – the level of income or expenditure below which 50% of the population lives. This variable gives the ratio of the two. It is a measure of inequality within the top half of the distribution. It tells you how many times richer someone in the middle of the distribution would need to be in order to be counted in the richest tenth.
p50_p10_ratio,P50 is the median – the level of income or expenditure below which 50% of the population lives. P10 is the the level of income or expenditure below which 10% of the population lives.
