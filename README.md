# Association between depressive disorders and various factors in adolescents by country
—

## Motivation

Depression is one of the most common affective spectrum disorders [^1]. The exact causes of depression have not been identified, but it is known that it is influenced by many factors: from genetic predisposition to environmental influences, as well as many socio-economic factors [^2]. Teenagers, due to rapid hormonal adjustment and growth, may be particularly vulnerable to depression [^3].

## Aim, tasks and data

**Aim:** To analyze the dependence of the number of adolescent patients suffering from depressive disorders on socio-economic factors in different countries.

**Tasks:**

* Search and data collection
* Exploratory analysis
* Hypotheses based on data
* Data analysis to find causal relationships between data

**Workflow**

1. Literature search
2. Selection of hypotheses
3. Search for open data to study hypotheses
4. Data analysis

**Data**

As the main dataset, we used data that was obtained from the [GBD](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/) open database of the Institute of Health Indicators and Assessment. They provide a quantitative assessment of the impact of the disease on health based on various indicators.

Data to hypotheses will be added in the description of hypotheses.

## Methods and Results



### **Hypothesis No. 1.** The relationship of the average level of school education with the level of depression [^5],[^6],[^7]

To test this hypothesis, data from the [PISA](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/) test and the [TIMSS](https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss-landing.html) test were used. PISA is the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment. PISA measures 15-year-olds’ ability to use their reading, mathematics and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges. TIMSS has monitored trends in mathematics and science achievement every four years, at the fourth and eighth grades.

In both cases, there is a small dependence, which was further checked for correlation between factors.

Also in the case of the PISA test, the trend repeats at the end of almost every test.

### **Hypothesis No. 2.** The relationship between hunger and the incidence of depression in adolescents and young people



### **Hypothesis No. 3.** The relationship of gender differences with the number of patients with depression
